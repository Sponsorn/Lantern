Lantern is a modular QoL addon for World of Warcraft. It bundles small, focused features you can toggle on/off:

*   **Auto Quest**: Accepts and turns in quests automatically (Shift to pause). Possibility to add both NPC and Quest to blocklist.

*   **Auto Queue**: Auto-accepts LFG role checks using your roles set in the LFG tool (Shift to pause).
*   **Delete Confirm**: Hides the delete prompt input and enables the confirm button immediately.
*   **Disable Auto Add Spells**: Prevents spells from being auto-added to your action bars.
*   **Cursor Ring**: Displays customizable ring(s) around your mouse cursor with cast/GCD indicators and an optional mouse trail. Supports two independent rings, three cast effect styles (segments, fill, swipe), a GCD swipe indicator, and a center dot. Includes preview buttons to test animations from the options panel. Disabled by default.
*   **Missing Pet**: Displays an animated on-screen warning when your pet is missing or set to passive. Works for Hunters, Warlocks, Unholy Death Knights, and Frost Mages with Water Elemental. Customizable text, colors, fonts, animations, and optional sound alerts. Auto-hides while mounted.

The framework is module-based, so additional features can be plugged in later without impacting the core.

#### Available modules:

*   Crafting Orders: Functionality to get info if you received a personal crafting order, send guild message when placing orders.
*   Warband: Organize characters into groups with automated gold balancing to/from warbank when opening a bank.
