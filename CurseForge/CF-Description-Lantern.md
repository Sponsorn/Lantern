*   **Auto Keystone**: Automatically slots your Mythic+ keystone when the Challenge Mode UI opens.

*   **Cursor Ring**: Displays customizable ring(s) around your mouse cursor with cast/GCD indicators and an optional mouse trail. Supports two independent rings, three cast effect styles (segments, fill, swipe), a GCD swipe indicator, and a center dot. Includes preview buttons to test animations from the options panel. Disabled by default.
*   **Death Release Protection**: Requires holding your pause modifier for 1 second to release spirit, preventing accidental clicks. Disabled by default.
*   **Delete Confirm**: Hides the delete prompt input and enables the confirm button immediately.
*   **Disable Auto Add Spells**: Prevents spells from being auto-added to your action bars.
*   **Disable Loot Warnings**: Auto-confirms bind-on-pickup, loot roll, merchant refund, and mail lock popups with per-type toggles.
*   **Faster Loot**: Instantly collects all loot when a loot window opens, with inventory-full warning.
*   **Missing Pet**: Displays an animated on-screen warning when your pet is missing or set to passive. Works for Hunters, Warlocks, Unholy Death Knights, and Frost Mages with Water Elemental. Customizable text, colors, fonts, animations, and optional sound alerts. Auto-hides while mounted.
*   **Range Check**: Color-coded distance display to your target with two modes: range numbers or in/out of range status (auto-detects your spec's max range). Disabled by default.

The framework is module-based, so additional features can be plugged in later without impacting the core.

#### Companion addons:

*   **Crafting Orders**: Functionality to get info if you received a personal crafting order, send guild message when placing orders.
*   **Warband**: Organize characters into groups with automated gold balancing to/from warbank when opening a bank.
