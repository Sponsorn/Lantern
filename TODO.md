TODO
----
- profiles to have different options enabled?
- crafting orders: reintroduce materials tag with reliable "all missing/some missing/all provided" detection
- add localization for other versions
- add durability with edit mode lib
- add summoning portal into core - /say current target and ask for help, maybe add optional notification if someone else is summoning
- crafting orders: save last crafting cost known across warband into tooltip
- cursorring: when installing the addon, disabled states are not read correctly
- audit codebase for band-aid fixes / workarounds that should be proper root-cause fixes
- screen calmer module: remove drunk blur, disable screen shake, skip death grayscale, tone down spell effects (sensory accessibility)
- login briefing module: proactive summary on login (expiring mail, vault slots, uncollected crafting orders, daily/weekly resets, unspent profession knowledge)
- import/export settings: copy/paste string pattern (like WeakAuras) for sharing configurations between characters or players
- new module: character screen improvements, ilvl, gems, enchants
- warband: fix font selection, maybe revert to old game font
- cursor ring: add stack tracker for spells/buffs, radial x/y selector, per class
- cursor ring: extract trail code (state, pool, sparkles, OnUpdate) into separate CursorRing/Trail.lua file — CursorRing.lua is 1400+ lines
