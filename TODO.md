TODO
----
- profiles to have different options enabled?
- crafting orders: reintroduce materials tag with reliable "all missing/some missing/all provided" detection
- add localization for other versions
- add durability with edit mode lib
- add summoning portal into core - /say current target and ask for help, maybe add optional notification if someone else is summoning
- crafting orders: save last crafting cost known across warband into tooltip
- cursorring: when installing the addon, disabled states are not read correctly
- audit codebase for band-aid fixes / workarounds that should be proper root-cause fixes
- screen calmer module: remove drunk blur, disable screen shake, skip death grayscale, tone down spell effects (sensory accessibility)
- login briefing module: proactive summary on login (expiring mail, vault slots, uncollected crafting orders, daily/weekly resets, unspent profession knowledge)
- import/export settings: copy/paste string pattern (like WeakAuras) for sharing configurations between characters or players
- cursorring: give Preview toggle a distinct visual treatment (button style) so it reads as a tool, not a setting
- auto quest: compatibility note ("other quest addons may bypass blocklist") should use a callout style (left border accent or tinted background)
