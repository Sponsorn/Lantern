TODO
----
- profiles to have different options enabled?
- crafting orders: reintroduce materials tag with reliable "all missing/some missing/all provided" detection
- add localization for other versions
- add durability with edit mode lib
- add summoning portal into core - /say current target and ask for help, maybe add optional notification if someone else is summoning
- crafting orders: save last crafting cost known across warband into tooltip
- login briefing module: proactive summary on login (expiring mail, vault slots, uncollected crafting orders, daily/weekly resets, unspent profession knowledge)
- import/export settings: copy/paste string pattern (like WeakAuras) for sharing configurations between characters or players
- cursor ring: add stack tracker for spells/buffs, radial x/y selector, per class
