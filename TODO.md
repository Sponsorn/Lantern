TODO
----
- profiles to have different options enabled?
- crafting orders: reintroduce materials tag with reliable "all missing/some missing/all provided" detection
- add localization for other versions
- add durability with edit mode lib
- add summoning portal into core - /say current target and ask for help, maybe add optional notification if someone else is summoning
- crafting orders: save last crafting cost known across warband into tooltip
- warband: fix characters screen showing unknown character after name-realm
- warband/warbank: fix proper cast bar instead of yank
